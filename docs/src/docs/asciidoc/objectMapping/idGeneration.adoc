By default in GORM entities are supplied with an integer-based identifier. So for example the following entity:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {}
----

Has a property called `id` of type `java.lang.Long`. In this case GORM for Mongo will generate a sequence based identifier using the technique http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/isolate-sequence-of-operations/[described in the Mongo documentation] on Atomic operations.

However, sequence based integer identifiers are not ideal for environments that require http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/sharding/[sharding] (one of the nicer features of Mongo). Hence it is generally advised to use either String based ids:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String id
}
----

Or a native BSON http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/org/bson/types/ObjectId.html[ObjectId]:

[source,groovy]
----
import org.bson.types.ObjectId

class Person {
    ObjectId id
}
----

BSON `ObjectId` instances are generated in a similar fashion to `UUIDs`.


==== Assigned Identifiers


Note that if you manually assign an identifier, then you will need to use the `insert` method instead of the `save` method, otherwise GORM can't work out whether you are trying to achieve an insert or an update. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String id
}
...
Person p = new Person()
p.id = "Fred"
// to insert
p.insert()
// to update
p.save()
----

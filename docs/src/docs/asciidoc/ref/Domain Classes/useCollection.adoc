===== Description

The `useCollection` method allows switching, at runtime, the collection used persist and retrieve domain classes. The `collectionName` property will return the current collection being used. Note that the method switches the collection used for the scope of the current session/connection (ie. it is not permanent). If you wish to permanently change the collection used then you need to configure the mapping of the domain class.

As mentioned previously, GORM for MongoDB supports all three multi tenancy modes however there are some considerations to keep in mind.

==== Database Per Tenant

When using the `DATABASE` mode, only GORM methods calls are dispatched to the correct tenant. This means the following will use the tenant id:

[source,groovy]
----
// switches to the correct client based on the tenant id
Book.list()
----

However, going directly through the `MongoClient` will not work:

[source,groovy]
----
@Autowired MongoClient mongoClient

// uses the default connection and doesn't resolve the tenant it
mongoClient.getDatabase("book").find()
----

If you are working directly with the `MongoClient` instance you need to make sure you obtain the correct instance. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.gorm.multitenancy.*

@Autowired MongoDatastore mongoDatastore
...
MongoClient mongoClient =
        mongoDatastore.getDatastoreForTenantId(Tenants.currentId())
                      .getMongoClient()
----

==== Schema Per Tenant

When using the `SCHEMA` mode, GORM for MongoDB will use a different MongoDB database, but the same `MongoClient` instance, for each tenant.

However, once again only GORM methods will use the correct database. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
// switches to the correct database based on the tenant id
Book.list()
----

However, getting the database directly from `MongoClient` will not work:

[source,groovy]
----
@Autowired MongoClient mongoClient

// uses the default connection and doesn't resolve the tenant it
mongoClient.getDatabase("book").find()
----

To resolve this you should always use the `DB` property of the class which will ensure the right database is used:

[source,groovy]
----
// switches to the correct database based on the tenant id
Book.DB.find()
----

==== Partitioned Multi-Tenancy

When using the `DISCRIMINATOR` approach, GORM for MongoDB will store a `tenantId` attribute in each MongoDB document and attempt to partition the data.

Once again this works only when using GORM methods and even then there are cases where it will not work if you use native MongoDB interfaces.

For example the following works fine:

[source,groovy]
----
// correctly includes the `tenantId` in the query
Book.list()
----

As does this:

[source,groovy]
----
import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;

// correctly includes the `tenantId` in the query
Book.find(eq("title", "The Stand")).first()
----

But this logic bypasses any built into tenant id interception and inclusion:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.collection.find().first()
----

Since you are operating directly on the collection GORM cannot know when you perform a query on said collection.

In this case you will have to ensure to include the `tenantId` manually:

[source,groovy]
----
import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
...
Book.collection.find(eq("tenantId", Tenants.currentId())).first()
----

And the same is true of write operations such as inserts that are done with the native API.

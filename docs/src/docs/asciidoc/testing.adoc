To write unit tests with MongoDB and Spock you can simply extend from `grails.test.mongodb.MongoSpec`.

`MongoSpec` is an abstract class that will initialise GORM in the setup phase of the specification being executed. It
uses by default a `MongoClient` instance that connects to a MongoDB instance as defined in your configuration
(by default, `localhost` and port `27017`, see <<gettingStarted>> for more details):

It is preferable to use testcontainers to automatically run MongoDB in a containerized environment and not have to run a MongoDB instance locally. The following examples use testcontainers:

----

include::{sourcedir}/examples/grails3-mongodb/src/test/groovy/functional/tests/LocalMongoUnitSpec.groovy[tags=structure]

You can also use your own low-level `MongoClient` instance, as shown in the following example:

include::{sourcedir}/examples/grails3-mongodb/src/test/groovy/functional/tests/BookUnitSpec.groovy[]

Note that the default implementation is to scan your classpath searching for domain classes, from the package defined
in the configuration property `grails.codegen.defaultPackage`, and all the way down its subpackages. If your application
is large, classpath scanning may be slow, so it's better to override the method `getDomainClasses()`:
